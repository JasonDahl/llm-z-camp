T HE LAWS OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY AND conservation of momentum that we have studied up to this point give us powerful tools to solve physics problems . As mentioned before , these two principles are not only applicable for classical physics , but can be applied to the very small ( quantum systems ) and the very fast ( relativistic systems ) . Interestingly , there is some question as to the conservation of energy on the very , very large scale \\u2013 we \\u2019 re not sure that energy conservation works for the universe as a whole . Regardless , the principles of energy and momentum are so pervasive that it is impossible to overstate their important in all of science . There are another set of \\u201c laws \\u201d that can be used to solve physics problems \\u2013 Newton \\u2019 s laws of motion . Although often called laws , they are not conservation laws like energy and momentum , but rather a set of rules that work extremely well in the classical limit . As summarized in Unit 103 , the three laws are Newton \\u2019 s 1st Law : In an inertial reference frame , an object remains at rest or continues Figure 119-1 . Newton \\u2019 s to move at constant velocity ( speed and direction ) unless acted on by an laws from the original outside force . Principia . Newton \\u2019 s 2nd Law : The vector sum of forces on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the object . In the case where the mass of the object remains the same , the vector sum of forces is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration of the object . Newton \\u2019 s 3rd Law : When two objects interact , the force exerted on the first object by the second object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force on the second object by the first object . In Unit 119 , we explore the basics of these three laws . Units 120 through 122 will explore the particulars of position , velocity and acceleration . Then , units 123 through 129 build up a repertoire of techniques that can be used to solve problems using Newton \\u2019 s three laws . We will see along the way that almost all of the problems we solved using energy and momentum can also be solved using forces and Newton \\u2019 s laws . The power of knowing each technique is that one problem may be much easier to solve using Newton \\u2019 s laws rather than energy considerations , but another problem may be more suited to the energy and momentum principles .\",\n",

We will see in Newton \\u2019 s 2nd law that an object \\u2019 s ability to resist changes in motion is directly proportional to its mass , so an object \\u2019 s mass is direct measure of its inertia .

      "        \"content\": \"Consider : How can we visualize the forces on an object ? When dealing with forces , it is often advisable to make diagram for each object of interest in the system with every force on each object noted . Such a diagram is called a free-body diagram , because we draw each object separate ( free ) and diagram out each force on the diagram . Free-body diagrams are also sometimes called force diagrams . Figure 119-2 shows the free-body diagram of a ball in free fall , i.e . under only the influence of the gravitational force , \\ud835\\udc39\\u20d7 . Some things to note about this diagram ( cid:3034 ) Figure 119-2 . Free- body diagram of a 1 ) The object ( ball ) is represented in a way that it can be identified . ball in free-fall . 2 ) The only force acting on the ball ( gravity ) is identified and drawn as a vector in the direction which it acts . 3 ) No other extraneous information is in the diagram itself . When more than one force acts on an object , each force is drawn on the same diagram . Be sure to include all forces that act on the object , but not any forces caused by the object . Figure 119- 3 shows the free-body diagram for a box sitting on a table such that it undergoes two interactions \\u2013 a normal interaction with the table and a gravitational interaction with the earth . Note that the force on the box due to each of these interactions is noted in the free-body diagram . When drawing free-body diagrams , try to follow these rules : Drawing Free-Body Diagrams Figure 119-3 . Free- body diagram of a 1 ) Draw a representative diagram for the object box sitting on a 2 ) Identify all forces that act directly on the object . In physics I , most forces ( except gravity ) table . will be due to direct contact with the object . 3 ) Draw and label an arrow for each force with the direction of the arrow representing the direction of the force . Try to have the tail of each arrow at the place where the force acts on the object . Drawing free-body diagrams correctly can make all the difference for solving force problems . We will see that when writing out Newton \\u2019 s 2nd law equations for an object , if you have a correctly formatted free-body diagram , it is simply a matter of converting the forces in the diagram to the equation . In this way , the visual representation of a problem can directly translate to the mathematical representation .\",\n",

Let \\u2019 s compare an astronaut at the surface of the earth and at the surface of the moon . In Unit 106 , we noted that the gravitational field strength at the surface of the moon is roughly 1/6th the strength of the gravitational field at the surface of the earth .

Note that this statement has the same type of force and the object causing the force and acted on by the force are reversed , as are the directions . Now , consider a box sitting on a flat table ( see Figure 119-3 ) . There are two forces acting on the box , the gravitational force of the earth on the box ( downward ) and the normal force of the table on the box ( upward ) . Note : The normal force is not the 3rd law pair of the gravitational force . As we just saw above , the 3rd law pair of the gravitational force on the box by the earth is a gravitational force of the box on the earth . What about the normal force ? Using our sentence pairs , we have For the normal force on the box by the table directed up , the third law pair is A normal force of the box on the table directed down . The box pushes down on the table just as much as the table pushes up on the box . A few notes about third law pairs 1 ) Third law pairs will never be in the same free body diagram since they act on different objects . 2 ) If you have a problem with multiple interacting objects , it \\u2019 s often good to note third law pairs in some way ( subscripts ) . For example , if box 1 pushes on box 2 with a force of magnitude F , the in the other free body 21 diagram you may want to call the force of box 2 on box 1 F . This is tantamount to eliminating one unknown , since 12 you know those forces have the same magnitude and opposite direction .
